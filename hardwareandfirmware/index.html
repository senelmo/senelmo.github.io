			<p class="mewritingarea" style="font-size:32px">Diablo Mountain Research has developed a number hardware and firmware cores centered around contemporary FPGA (Xilinx and Altera) and RISC processors including the Arduino, Raspberry PI, ST Micro systems Neucleo platform., and the MicroChip DSP and Risc processors. Applications are suited to Medical Devices, Biotech, Scientific Instrumentation, and Industrial Applications. Firmware Code has been thoroughly tested using both black box and white box techniques. We test to ISO standards.
				<br>
				<br>
This allows for rapid development at a cost reduction due to design reuse. Diablo Mountain Research will share these cores for a small licensing fee and the cost to tune the asset to the application.
				<br>
				<br>
We  have a variety of analog circuitry cores centered around very low noise Electropical Photonic Signal Detection Fronends. Our optical front ends have been used by companies working in the area of Photon Microscopy. This has been applied to Real Time COVID 19 detection with just a cheek swab with test results in minutes vs days. 
				<br>
				<br>
We provide high energy  cores for Electrosurgery and Xray (high powering). We have broadband AGC circuitry available as well as low noise isolated amplification for Medical Devices.
				<br>
				<br>
We supply very low noise high voltage power supplies for applications such  as powering PMTs for single photon detection.
				<br>
				<br>
We can supply all analog or digital "Lockin Amplifier' frontends for detecting low level signals embedded in noise. We have achieved signal detection over 100dB SNR.
				<br>
				<br>
We can also supply off the shelf TEC "closed loop" control systems for PCR , precision temperature control of lasers and precise temperature control of enclosed environments.
				<br>
				<br>
We have both low power RF frontends for detection of signal from 10khz (and lower) to over  10Ghz>
				<br>
				<br>
We have low power and high power RF/Microwave amplifiers that can be used for Medical and Scientific/Industrial RF power transmission and heating.( Low KHZ to GHZ).
